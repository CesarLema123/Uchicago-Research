The QM8 is the dataset used in a study on modeling quantum mechanical calculations of electronic spectra and excited state energy of small molecules. Multiple methods, including time-dependent density functional theories (TDDFT) and second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2), are applied to a collection of molecules that include up to eight heavy atoms (also a subset of the GDB-17 database). In our collection, there are four excited state properties calculated by four different methods on 22 thousand samples:
	S_0 -> S_1 transition energy E_1 and the corresponding oscillator strength f_1
	S_0 -> S_2 transition energy E_2 and the corresponding oscillator strength f_2

The data files:
qm8.sdf: molecular structures
qm8.sdf.csv: tables for molecular properties
	Column 1:      Molecule ID (gdb9 index) mapping to the .sdf file
	Columns 2-5:   RI-CC2/def2TZVP; 	E1, E2, f1, f2 in atomic units. f1, f2 in length representation
	Columns 6-9:   LR-TDPBE0/def2SVP;	E1, E2, f1, f2 in atomic units. f1, f2 in length representation
	Columns 10-13: LR-TDPBE0/def2TZVP;	E1, E2, f1, f2 in atomic units. f1, f2 in length representation
	Columns 14-17: LR-TDCAM-B3LYP/def2TZVP;	E1, E2, f1, f2 in atomic units. f1, f2 in length representation
